1.
You can send the best only bytes, because of compatibility on different platforms.
https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/network-packet.php


To send data, you must call the send function with a pointer to the data that you want to send,
and the number of bytes to send. 
char data[100] = ...;

// TCP socket:
if (socket.send(data, 100) != sf::Socket::Done)
{
    // error...
}

// UDP socket:
sf::IpAddress recipient = "192.168.0.5";
unsigned short port = 54000;
if (socket.send(data, 100, recipient, port) != sf::Socket::Done)
{
    // error...
}
The send functions take a void* pointer, so you can pass the address of anything. However,
it is generally a bad idea to send something other than an array of bytes because native types
with a size larger than 1 byte are not guaranteed to be the same on every machine: Types such
as int or long may have a different size, and/or a different endianness. Therefore, such types
cannot be exchanged reliably across different systems. This problem is explained (and solved)
in the tutorial on packets.
